      <h3 style="color: aquamarine; text-align: center">Music is subjective.</h3>
      <p style="color: white; text-align: center">I think a lot of people can agree when I say music plays an important part of our lives. Even for folks who do not listen much, certain events like weddings tend to have music and along with the memory, the music sticks. Maybe one day you are watching a movie and suddenly the same song comes on. It sparks memories of the wedding. <em>This goes for our entire lives.</em></p>
